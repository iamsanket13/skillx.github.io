                    A blockchain,originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). <br>
                    The blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date.

            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">Blockchain is a specific type of database.
                It differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks
                that are then chained together.
                As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained
                onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
                Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as
                a ledger for transactions.
                In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has
                control—rather, all users collectively retain control.
                Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin,
                this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.

            <p class="sectTag text-b">WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?</p>
            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">Blockchain seems complicated, and it definitely can be, but its core concept is
                really quite simple. A blockchain is a type of database. To be able to understand blockchain, it helps
                to first understand what a database actually. <br>


                A database is a collection of information that is stored electronically on a computer system.
                Information, or data, in databases is typically structured in table format to allow for easier searching
                and filtering for specific information. What is the difference between someone using a spreadsheet to
                store information rather than a database?<br>


                Spreadsheets are designed for one person, or a small group of people, to store and access limited
                amounts of information. In contrast, a database is designed to house significantly larger amounts of
                information that can be accessed, filtered, and manipulated quickly and easily by any number of users at
                once.<br>Large databases achieve this by housing data on servers that are made of powerful computers.
                These servers can sometimes be built using hundreds or thousands of computers in order to have the
                computational power and storage capacity necessary for many users to access the database simultaneously.
                While a spreadsheet or database may be accessible to any number of people, it is often owned by a
                business and managed by an appointed individual that has complete control over how it works and the data
                within it.

            <p class="sectTag text-b">SO HOW DOES A BLOCKCHAIN DIFFERS FROM A DATABASE?</p>
            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">

                <h3>STORAGE STRUCTURE</h3> <br>
                One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is the way the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, also known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are chained onto the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the “blockchain.” All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled. <br>
                
                A database structures its data into tables whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are chained together. This makes it so that all blockchains are databases but not all databases are blockchains. This system also inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the chain. <br> <br>
                
               <h3> <b>
                Transaction Process <br>

                Attributes of Cryptocurrency <br>
                Blockchain <br>
                Decentralization </b></h3> <br> <br>
                
                For the purpose of understanding blockchain, it is instructive to view it in the context of how it has been implemented by Bitcoin. Like a database, Bitcoin needs a collection of computers to store its blockchain. For Bitcoin, this blockchain is just a specific type of database that stores every Bitcoin transaction ever made. In Bitcoin’s case, and unlike most databases, these computers are not all under one roof, and each computer or group of computers is operated by a unique individual or group of individuals.  <br>
                
                
                Imagine that a company owns a server comprised of 10,000 computers with a database holding all of its client’s account information. This company has a warehouse containing all of these computers under one roof and has full control of each of these computers and all the information contained within them. Similarly, Bitcoin consists of thousands of computers, but each computer or group of computers that hold its blockchain is in a different geographic location and they are all operated by separate individuals or groups of people. These computers that makeup Bitcoin’s network are called nodes. <br>
                
                In this model, Bitcoin’s blockchain is used in a decentralized way. However, private, centralized blockchains, where the computers that make up its network are owned and operated by a single entity, do exist. <br>
                
                In a blockchain, each node has a full record of the data that has been stored on the blockchain since its inception. For Bitcoin, the data is the entire history of all Bitcoin transactions. If one node has an error in its data it can use the thousands of other nodes as a reference point to correct itself. This way, no one node within the network can alter information held within it. Because of this, the history of transactions in each block that make up Bitcoin’s blockchain is irreversible. <br>
                
                If one user tampers with Bitcoin’s record of transactions, all other nodes would cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the incorrect information. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. For Bitcoin, this information is a list of transactions, but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company’s product inventory. <br>
                
                
                In order to change how that system works, or the information stored within it, a majority of the decentralized network’s computing power would need to agree on said changes. This ensures that whatever changes do occur are in the best interests of the majority. <br> <br>
                
                <h3>TRANSPARENCY</h3> <br>
                Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or by using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes. <br>
                
                For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past where those who held Bitcoin on the exchange lost everything. While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily traceable. If the Bitcoins that were stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be known.

            <p class="sectTag text-b">IS BLOCKCHAIN SECURE?</p>
            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">Blockchain technology accounts for the issues of security and trust in several
                ways. First, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added
                to the “end” of the blockchain. If you take a look at Bitcoin’s blockchain, you’ll see that each block
                has a position on the chain, called a “height.” As of November 2020, the block’s height had reached
                656,197 blocks so far. <br>

                After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, it is very difficult to go back and alter the
                contents of the block unless the majority reached a consensus to do so. That’s because each block
                contains its own hash, along with the hash of the block before it, as well as the previously mentioned
                time stamp. Hash codes are created by a math function that turns digital information into a string of
                numbers and letters. If that information is edited in any way, the hash code changes as well. <br>

                Here’s why that’s important to security. Let’s say a hacker wants to alter the blockchain and steal
                Bitcoin from everyone else. If they were to alter their own single copy, it would no longer align with
                everyone else’s copy. When everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would
                see this one copy stand out and that hacker’s version of the chain would be cast away as illegitimate.
                <br>

                Succeeding with such a hack would require that the hacker simultaneously control and alter 51% of the
                copies of the blockchain so that their new copy becomes the majority copy and thus, the agreed-upon
                chain. Such an attack would also require an immense amount of money and resources as they would need to
                redo all of the blocks because they would now have different timestamps and hash codes. <br>

                Due to the size of Bitcoin’s network and how fast it is growing, the cost to pull off such a feat would
                probably be insurmountable. Not only would this be extremely expensive, but it would also likely be
                fruitless. Doing such a thing would not go unnoticed, as network members would see such drastic
                alterations to the blockchain. The network members would then fork off to a new version of the chain
                that has not been affected. <br>

                This would cause the attacked version of Bitcoin to plummet in value, making the attack ultimately
                pointless as the bad actor has control of a worthless asset. The same would occur if the bad actor were
                to attack the new fork of Bitcoin. It is built this way so that taking part in the network is far more
                economically incentivized than attacking it.

            <p class="sectTag text-b">BITCOIN VS. BLOCKCHAIN</p>
            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and
                distributed, but not edited. Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W.
                Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be
                tampered with. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009,
                that blockchain had its first real-world application. <br>

                The Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency,
                Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s
                fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” <br>

                The key thing to understand here is that Bitcoin merely uses blockchain as a means to transparently
                record a ledger of payments, but blockchain can, in theory, be used to immutably record any number of
                data points. As discussed above, this could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election,
                product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more. <br>

                Currently, there is a vast variety of blockchain-based projects looking to implement blockchain in ways
                to help society other than just recording transactions. One good example is that of blockchain being
                used as a way to vote in democratic elections. The nature of blockchain’s immutability means that
                fraudulent voting would become far more difficult to occur. <br>

                For example, a voting system could work such that each citizen of a country would be issued a single
                cryptocurrency or token. Each candidate would then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters
                would send their token or crypto to whichever candidate’s address they wish to vote for. The transparent
                and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting as well as the
                ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.

            <p class="sectTag text-b">HOW IS BLOCKCHAIN USED ?</p>
            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">As we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store data about monetary
                transactions. But it turns out that blockchain is actually a reliable way of storing data about other
                types of transactions, as well. <br>

                Some companies that have already incorporated blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens,
                Unilever, and a host of others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain1 to trace the
                journey that food products take to get to its locations. <br>

                Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of e Coli, salmonella, listeria, as well as
                hazardous materials being accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the
                source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating. <br>

                Using blockchain gives brands the ability to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each
                stop it makes, and finally its delivery. If a food is found to be contaminated then it can be traced all
                the way back through each stop to its origin. Not only that, but these companies can also now see
                everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur
                far sooner, potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchains in practice, but there are many
                other forms of blockchain implementation.

                Perhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than
                banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, five days a week. That means if you
                try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see
                that money hit your account. Even if you do make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can
                still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to
                settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps. <br>

                By integrating blockchain into banks, consumers can see their transactions processed in as little as 10
                minutes,2 basically the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the
                time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between
                institutions more quickly and securely. In the stock trading business, for example, the settlement and
                clearing process can take up to three days (or longer, if trading internationally), meaning that the
                money and shares are frozen for that period of time. <br>

                Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days that the money is in transit can carry
                significant costs and risks for banks. European bank Santander and its research partners put the
                potential savings at $15 billion to $20 billion a year.3 Capgemini, a French consultancy, estimates that
                consumers could save up to $16 billion in banking and insurance fees each year4 through blockchain-based
                applications.

            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">Blockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The U.S. dollar
                is controlled by the Federal Reserve. Under this central authority system, a user’s data and currency
                are technically at the whim of their bank or government. If a user’s bank is hacked, the client’s
                private information is at risk. If the client’s bank collapses or they live in a country with an
                unstable government, the value of their currency may be at risk. In 2008, some of the banks that ran out
                of money were bailed out partially using taxpayer money. These are the worries out of which Bitcoin was
                first conceived and developed. <br>

                By spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain allows Bitcoin and other
                cryptocurrencies to operate without the need for a central authority. This not only reduces risk but
                also eliminates many of the processing and transaction fees. It can also give those in countries with
                unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency with more applications and a
                wider network of individuals and institutions they can do business with, both domestically and
                internationally. <br>

                Using cryptocurrency wallets for savings accounts or as a means of payment is especially profound for
                those who have no state identification. Some countries may be war-torn or have governments that lack any
                real infrastructure to provide identification. Citizens of such countries may not have access to savings
                or brokerage accounts and therefore, no way to safely store wealth.

            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">If you have ever spent time in your local Recorder’s Office, you will know that
                the process of recording property rights is both burdensome and inefficient. Today, a physical deed must
                be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where it is manually entered into
                the county’s central database and public index. In the case of a property dispute, claims to the
                property must be reconciled with the public index. <br>

                This process is not just costly and time-consuming—it is also riddled with human error, where each
                inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate
                the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If
                property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is
                accurate and permanently recorded. <br>

                In war-torn countries or areas that have little to no government or financial infrastructure, and
                certainly no “Recorder’s Office,” it can be nearly impossible to prove ownership of a property. If a
                group of people living in such an area is able to leverage blockchain, transparent and clear timelines
                of property ownership could be established.

            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">A smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to
                facilitate, verify, or negotiate a contract agreement. Smart contracts operate under a set of conditions
                that users agree to. When those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried
                out. <br>

                Say, for example, a potential tenant would like to lease an apartment using a smart contract. The
                landlord agrees to give the tenant the door code to the apartment as soon as the tenant pays the
                security deposit. Both the tenant and the landlord would send their respective portions of the deal to
                the smart contract, which would hold onto and automatically exchange the door code for the security
                deposit on the date the lease begins. If the landlord doesn’t supply the door code by the lease date,
                the smart contract refunds the security deposit. This would eliminate the fees and processes typically
                associated with the use of a notary, third-party mediator, or attornies.

            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">
                For all of its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost
                without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer
                errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are
                also some disadvantages.

            <h3>PROS</h3>
            (1) Improved accuracy by removing human involvement in verification <br>

            (2) Cost reductions by eliminating third-party verification <br>

            (3) Decentralization makes it harder to tamper with <br>

            (4) Transactions are secure, private, and efficient <br>

            (5) Transparent technology <br>

            (6) Provides a banking alternative and way to secure personal information for citizens of countries with
            unstable or underdeveloped governments

            <h3>CONS</h3>
            (1) Significant technology cost associated with mining bitcoin <br>

            (2) Low transactions per second <br>

            (3) History of use in illicit activities <br>

            (4) Regulation <br>

            <p class="sectTag text-b">ADVANTAGES OF BLOCKHAIN</p>
            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">
            <h3>ACCURACY OF THE CHAIN</h3> <br>
            Transactions on the blockchain network are approved by a network of thousands of computers. This removes
            almost all human involvement in the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate
            record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error
            would only be made to one copy of the blockchain. In order for that error to spread to the rest of the
            blockchain, it would need to be made by at least 51% of the network’s computers—a near impossibility for a
            large and growing network the size of Bitcoin’s. <br> <br>

            <h3>COST REDUCTIONS</h3> <br>
            Typically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction, a notary to sign a document, or a minister to
            perform a marriage. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification and, with it, their
            associated costs. Business owners incur a small fee whenever they accept payments using credit cards, for
            example, because banks and payment processing companies have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the
            other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees. <br> <br>

            <h3>DECENTRALIZATION</h3> <br>
            Blockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied
            and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on
            the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. By spreading that information across a network,
            rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with. If a copy
            of the blockchain fell into the hands of a hacker, only a single copy of the information, rather than the
            entire network, would be compromised. <br> <br>

            <h3>EFFICIENT TRANSACTIONS</h3> <br>
            Transactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to
            deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday
            morning. Whereas financial institutions operate during business hours, five days a week, blockchain is
            working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Transactions can be completed in as little
            as ten minutes and can be considered secure after just a few hours. This is particularly useful for
            cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time-zone issues and the fact that all
            parties must confirm payment processing. <br> <br>

            <h3>PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS</h3> <br>
            Many blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning that anyone with an internet connection can
            view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access details about transactions, they
            cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common
            misperception that blockchain networks like bitcoin are anonymous, when in fact they are only confidential.
            <br>

            That is, when a user makes public transactions, their unique code called a public key, is recorded on the
            blockchain, rather than their personal information. If a person has made a Bitcoin purchase on an exchange
            that requires identification then the person’s identity is still linked to their blockchain address, but a
            transaction, even when tied to a person’s name, does not reveal any personal information. <br> <br>

            <h3>SECURE TRANSACTIONS</h3> <br>
            Once a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. Thousands of
            computers on the blockchain rush to confirm that the details of the purchase are correct. After a computer
            has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains
            its own unique hash, along with the unique hash of the block before it. When the information on a block is
            edited in any way, that block’s hashcode changes—however, the hash code on the block after it would not.
            This discrepancy makes it extremely difficult for information on the blockchain to be changed without
            notice. <br> <br>

            <h3>TRANSPARENCY</h3> <br>
            Most blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that anyone and everyone can view its code.
            This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. This also means that
            there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can
            suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of
            the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile then Bitcoin can be updated. <br><br>

            <h3>BANKING THE UNBANKED</h3> <br>
            Perhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and Bitcoin is the ability for anyone, regardless of
            ethnicity, gender, or cultural background, to use it. According to the world bank there are nearly 2 billion
            adults that do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth.5 Nearly all of these
            individuals live in developing countries where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.
            <br>

            These people often earn little money that is paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical
            cash in hidden locations in their homes or places of living leaving them subject to robbery or unnecessary
            violence. Keys to a bitcoin wallet can be stored on a piece of paper, a cheap cell phone, or even memorized
            if necessary. For most people, it is likely that these options are more easily hidden than a small pile of
            cash under a mattress. <br>

            Blockchains of the future are also looking for solutions to not only be a unit of account for wealth
            storage, but also to store medical records, property rights, and a variety of other legal contracts.

            <p class="sectTag text-b"> DISADVANTAGES OF BLOCKCHAIN</p>
            <p class="sectSubTag text-s">
                While there are significant upsides to the blockchain, there are also significant challenges to its
                adoption. The roadblocks to the application of blockchain technology today are not just technical. The
                real challenges are political and regulatory, for the most part, to say nothing of the thousands of
                hours (read: money) of custom software design and back-end programming required to integrate blockchain
                to current business networks. Here are some of the challenges standing in the way of widespread
                blockchain adoption.

            <h3>TECHNOLOGY COST</h3> <br>
            Although blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. The “proof of
            work” system that bitcoin uses to validate transactions, for example, consumes vast amounts of computational
            power. In the real world, the power from the millions of computers on the bitcoin network is close to what
            Denmark consumes annually. Assuming electricity costs of $0.03~$0.05 per kilowatt-hour, mining costs
            exclusive of hardware expenses are about $5,000~$7,000 per coin.10 <br>

            Despite the costs of mining bitcoin, users continue to drive up their electricity bills in order to validate
            transactions on the blockchain. That’s because when miners add a block to the bitcoin blockchain, they are
            rewarded with enough bitcoin to make their time and energy worthwhile. When it comes to blockchains that do
            not use cryptocurrency, however, miners will need to be paid or otherwise incentivized to validate
            transactions. <br>

            Some solutions to these issues are beginning to arise. For example, bitcoin mining farms have been set up to
            use solar power, excess natural gas from fracking sites, or power from wind farms. <br><br>

            <h3>SPEED INEFFICIENCY</h3> <br>
            Bitcoin is a perfect case study for the possible inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin’s “proof of work”
            system takes about ten minutes to add a new block to the blockchain. At that rate, it’s estimated that the
            blockchain network can only manage about seven transactions per second (TPS). Although other
            cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum perform better than bitcoin, they are still limited by blockchain. Legacy
            brand Visa, for context, can process 24,000 TPS. <br>

            Solutions to this issue have been in development for years. There are currently blockchains that are
            boasting over 30,000 transactions per second. <br><br>

            <h3>ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES</h3> <br>
            While confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, it also
            allows for illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network. The most cited example of blockchain
            being used for illicit transactions is probably the Silk Road, an online “dark web” drug marketplace
            operating from February 2011 until October 2013 when it was shut down by the FBI.6 <br>

            The website allowed users to browse the website without being tracked using the Tor browser and make illegal
            purchases in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Current U.S. regulations require financial service providers
            to obtain information about their customers when they open an account, verify the identity of each customer,
            and confirm that customers do not appear on any list of known or suspected terrorist organizations. This
            system can be seen as both a pro and a con. It gives anyone access to financial accounts but also allows
            criminals to more easily transact. Many have argued that the good uses of crypto, like banking the unbanked
            world, outweigh the bad uses of cryptocurrency, especially when most illegal activity is still accomplished
            through untraceable cash.

                over cryptocurrencies. While it is getting increasingly difficult and near impossible to end something
                like Bitcoin as its decentralized network grows, governments could theoretically make it illegal to own
                cryptocurrencies or participate in their networks. <br>

                Over time this concern has grown smaller as large companies like PayPal begin to allow the ownership and
                use of cryptocurrencies on its platform.
